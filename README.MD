<br />

Taking cues from the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, Earthworks adds some of the first materials mankind used to craft.  Materials like wattle and daub, wicker, rammed earth, and adobe bricks.  These are crude materials, fashioned out of what was at hand, and easily accessible, but prove to be as strong as stone when fashioned properly.  Utilizing these in an early build will provide some excellent shelters.

Since the original repo is unfortunately currently no longer maintained, we have decided to re-release the mod and continue supporting it for version 1.12.2 for the foreseeable future.
